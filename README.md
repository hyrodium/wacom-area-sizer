# wacom-area-sizer

I love the Wacom pen tablet, but it does not replace my mouse.
I want to illustrate figures in a specific area, not in the entire display.
`wacom-area-sizer` enables us to set up a drawing area with a simple GUI.

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/hyrodium/wacom-area-sizer
cd wacom-area-sizer
rye install .
```

# Usage

```
was
```

The command `was` will open a new window.

The area of the window will be the canvas area of the wacom tablet.
You can change the size and position of the canvas by dragging the window.

# Uninstall

```
rye uninstall wacom-area-sizer
```
